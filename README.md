Command-Driven Desktop Dictation & Text-to-Speech

TypeZero is a desktop-first dictation and text-to-speech application designed for power users who want to write without typing. It transforms spoken thoughts into structured, publish-ready text using intent-aware voice commands and local-first speech processing.

TypeZero runs on your device by default, prioritizing low latency and privacy. It is built for long writing sessions, documentation, and focused work on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Why TypeZero?

Most dictation apps focus only on raw transcription. TypeZero focuses on output quality and workflow control.

TypeZero is built for people who:

Write long-form content

Draft technical documentation

Think out loud while working

Want to format and structure text by voice

Prefer desktop workflows over mobile dictation

Key Features (Planned / In Progress)

🎙️ Offline dictation with local speech recognition

⌨️ Global hotkey to dictate into any app

🧠 Command-driven formatting

🧩 Writing profiles (Writing, Coding, Meetings)

✍️ Clean transcript editor with export

🔊 Text-to-speech for proofreading and review

🖥️ Desktop-first UX (macOS, Windows, Linux)

Philosophy

Local-first by default – speech processing runs on-device

Privacy-respecting – no silent uploads or tracking

Workflow-focused – built for deep work, not casual dictation

Composable – designed to integrate with professional writing workflows
